# LFM - Lagrangian Flamelet Model

>Initial code to solve the species transport equations in the mixture fraction space. It uses the profile of stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate of Peters. 

>The Crank-Nicolson finite difference method is used. 

>The complementary inverse error function erfc-1 (x) is solved using the the bisection method.
